# Double a Number Represented by a Linked List

## Problem Description

You are given a singly linked list representing a number in reverse order.
Each node contains a single digit. Your task is to double the number
and return a new linked list in the normal order (most significant digit first).

### Example

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3  (represents 321)  
Output: 6 -> 4 -> 2 (represents 642)
