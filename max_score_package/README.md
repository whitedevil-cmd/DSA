# Max Score from Tokens

This program calculates the maximum score that can be obtained from playing tokens.

## How It Works

- Play tokens face up to gain score if you have enough power.
- Play tokens face down to regain power if you have at least 1 score.

## Example

```
Input:
tokens = [100, 200, 300, 400]
power = 200

Output:
2
```

## Usage

Run the script and enter the list of tokens and the initial power.
