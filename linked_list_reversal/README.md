# Linked List Segment Reversal

This Python project performs an in-place reversal of a segment of a singly linked list, given the left and right indices (1-based).

## How It Works

- The linked list is constructed from user input.
- The sublist from `left` to `right` is reversed in place.
- The result is printed as a chain of node values.

## Example

```
Input:
list: Bread Eggs Milk Cheese Tomatoes
left= 2
right= 4

Output:
Bread -> Cheese -> Milk -> Eggs -> Tomatoes
```

## Run

```bash
python main.py
```
