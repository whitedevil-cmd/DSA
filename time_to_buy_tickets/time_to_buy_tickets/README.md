# Time to Buy Tickets

This script solves the "Time to Buy Tickets" problem.

## Problem

You have a queue where `tickets[i]` represents the number of tickets person `i` wants to buy.
Each person must wait until they reach the front of the queue. At each second, the person at the front of the queue buys a ticket and moves to the back if they still need more.

Return the time it takes for person `k` to finish buying all their tickets.

## Example

**Input:**  
tickets = [2, 3, 2], k = 2  
**Output:**  
6

## Run

```bash
python buy_tickets.py
```
