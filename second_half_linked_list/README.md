# DSA - Linked List: Second Half Finder

This project includes a Python implementation to find and print the second half of a singly linked list.

## How it works

- A linked list is created from user input.
- The middle node is found using the slow and fast pointer technique.
- The second half of the list (including the middle for odd-length lists) is printed.

## How to Run

```bash
python second_half_linked_list.py
```

### Example:

**Input:**
```
Enter list: 1 2 3 4 5
```

**Output:**
```
[3,4,5]
```
